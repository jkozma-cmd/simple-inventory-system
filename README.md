# Inventory Management System (Java)

## Overview
A simple console-based Java application to manage products in an inventory.  
This project demonstrates object-oriented design, user input handling, and dynamic data management.

## Features
- Add new products with ID, name, price, and quantity
- Remove existing products by ID
- View all current products in inventory
- Menu-driven interface using loops and switch statements
- Data stored dynamically with `ArrayList<Product>`

## Structure
- **Product.java** – Defines the `Product` class (ID, name, price, quantity)
- **Main.java** – Manages inventory operations and user interaction

## Skills Demonstrated
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Control structures (`if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`)
- Collections (`ArrayList`)
- User input handling with `Scanner`
- Formatted console output
